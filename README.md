## Description

For this assignment, a HTML file and CSS sheet for a website was provided. Upon investigating the HTML file, there were little comments, semantic elements and it was not very accessible. While the webpage opens in a web browser, there were links that did not function properly on the page. The first thing that was done was fixing broken links on the page and adding the appropriate HTML semantic elements to the page. Next, the classes on the CSS sheets were consolidated to prevent from using multiple classes that used the same style. Comments were also added to the sheet for easier reading. The website and the code are now cleaner and more accessible for future users of the website and engineers who work with the codebase.
